# Email Wallet Deployment Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and running the Email Wallet system, including smart contracts and the relayer service.

## Quick Start

If you just want to deploy contracts and run the relayer:
1. First, go to [packages/contracts](packages/contracts) and follow the instructions in the first section to deploy all contracts and register relayer data.
2. Keep the deployed addresses handy.
3. Then come back to [packages/relayer](packages/relayer) and follow the quick start instructions to run the relayer.
4. Run the front-end from [emailwallet.org](https://github.com/zkemail/emailwallet.org/tree/refactor/v1.1) repo
