Its instances are as follows:
1. the poseidon hash of the relayer's randomness (randomness hash) `relayer_rand_hash`.
2. an email address pointer `pointer`.
3. a commitment of the account key `ak_commit`.

It takes as input the following data:
1. a padded email header `in_padded`.
2. an RSA public key `pubkey`.
3. an RSA signature `signature`.
4. the bytes of the padded email header `in_padded_len`.

6. a starting position of the sender's email address in the email header `sender_email_idx`.
7. a starting position of the invitation code in the email header `code_idx`.
8. a starting position of the email domain in the sender's email address `domain_idx`.
9. a starting position of the timestamp in the email header `timestamp_idx`.

Its instances are as follows:
1. an email domain `domain_name`.

8. the old relayer's randomness hash `old_relayer_rand_hash`.

#### `claim.circom`
A circuit to verify the claim of unclaimed funds/states. 

It takes as input the following data.
1. an email address `recipient_email_addr`,
2. a relayer's randomness `recipient_relayer_rand`.
3. a randomness used for the email address commitment `cm_rand`.

Its instances are as follows:
1. the relayer's randomness hash `recipient_relayer_rand_hash`.
2. an email address pointer `recipient_pointer`.
3. an email address commitment `recipient_email_addr_commit`.

#### `email_sender.circom`
A circuit to verify the user's email for calling a command. 

It takes as input the following data.
1. a padded email header `in_padded`.
2. an RSA public key `pubkey`.
3. an RSA signature `signature`.
4. the bytes of the padded email header `in_padded_len`.
5. the sender relayer's randomness `sender_relayer_rand`.
6. a starting position of the sender's email address in the email header `sender_email_idx`.
7. a starting position of the subject in the email header `subject_idx`.
8. a starting position of the recipient's email address in the subject `recipient_email_idx`.
9. a starting position of the email domain in the sender's email address `domain_idx`.
10. a starting position of the timestamp in the email header `timestamp_idx`.

Its instances are as follows:
1. a masked subject where a character in the email address is replaced with zero  `masked_subject_str`.
2. an email domain `domain_name`.
3. a poseidon hash of the RSA public key `pubkey_hash`.
4. the sender relayer's randomness hash `sender_relayer_rand_hash`.
5. an nullifier of the email `email_nullifier`.
6. the sender's email address pointer `sender_pointer`.
7. a flag whether the subject contains the recipient's email address `has_email_recipient` (0 or 1).
8. the recipient's email address commitment `recipient_email_addr_commit`.
9. a timestamp in the email header `timestamp`.

#### `announcement.circom`
A circuit to verify that the given email address commitment is derived from the given email address and randomness. While it is not used in our core contracts, it is provided for third-party contracts to register unclaimed funds/states for the public email address and the randomness. 

It takes as input the following data:
1. an email address `email_addr`.
2. a randomness used for the email address commitment `cm_rand`.
    
Its instances are as follows:
1. a packed integer of the email address `email_addr_ints`.
2. an email address commitment `email_addr_commit`.
3. a randomness used for the email address commitment `cm_rand`.
